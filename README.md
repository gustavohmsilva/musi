**Musi is a maze game based entirely on sound. This game aims to be inclusive for people with blindness and temporary vision health problems.**

**This games uses keys that are easy to find on a tactile search through your keyboard (F, J, SPACE BAR and ESCAPE BUTTON) and all it's instructions are transmitted through audio to the player.**   

*This game was made using the Lua programming language with the Löve2D library, that being said, he will need that you have Löve2D installed in order to play. You can download and install Löve2D from their official website at https://www.love2d.org/*   

I'm not sure if I will include more levels and challenges to the game, as it was mainly developed for the #MusicGameJam and the #WeeklyGameJam. But **PLEASE let me know what do you think about the game, specially if this game is aimed for you. If people liked it. I'll improve the game and swear to do my best to make it into a full fledged 100 levels game**, with level selection and everything else necessary to make this a incredible adventure that is not only inclusive, but exciting!   

Put your headphones on and experience MUSI!   



*PS: I Highly recommend that people with normal vision try to play this game with their eyes closed (through it isn't necessary to do so). This way, you can not only enjoy the game on a whole other level, but also experience (at some small leve) the difficulties that people with disabilities face. Maybe this will help you keep people with disabilities when developing your own game or app.*   

**Let's make the world a better place for everyone!**
